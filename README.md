# CSCI-1175-Final-Project

My final project for CSCI 1175 Industry Projects is a chat application.
A server can connect to multiple clients at a time and each client can send and recive images and messages.
With the time I had i couldn't make it work across different computers, it just uses localhost.

## How to use

Run server.java
Run one or more Client.java
The server will be hosted on port 8000 by default.
The clients will have the data entered already.
Press "Connect" on the clients.
Clients can change username by changing the field with "User" already in it.
Clients can type and press enter to send a message, and send images by selecting a JPG file and pressing "send image".
Press "Shutdown Server" to close the server. This just ensures that the loops waiting for data stop.
The Clients can be exited normally.
